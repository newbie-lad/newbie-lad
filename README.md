i have some challenges, so that i see life differently — or, am [playing on different](https://media.tenor.com/wh2x1N-8TW0AAAPo/mario-videogames.mp4) skill level, if you will – i am kinda losing the battle, but nonetheless, i don't mind hanging/collaborating with people that are different than me [or are the way that i was]
um, wise words of experience? none. what have i done utterly wrongly: trusted someone (over and over)
what should someone that could be in my situation do? don't believe anything, ignore faith, hope, words and all the sweet lies. use only mind, in order to follow the right [not so painful] path

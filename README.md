- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @newbie-lad
- interested in everything that makes day-to-day life better with some exceptions of digital commodities, such as data management and connecting with people of the same mindset; cars, automation, agro, farm, logistiscs, manufactura, making people worry less, helping to not waste time â€” maybe, overall: _mindfulness_
- learning/using not-in-production: javascript, shell sl, mongodb, python; html-4, css-2, obviously; nn...
- looking to create things that others will find interesting at first and useful for years; for experience, good faith people, overall: prosper _(by doing what you love)_ and avoid stressing about; and, maybe, new challenges/prospects, trial-and-error, Â«we'll do this because it's coolÂ» (i just hate everythnig that wastes time â€” coping is not a mechanism for growth)
- i have experience in [graphical] design (how it works)

we are here to make this place better, not to make a mess around

### build your dreams, not someone else's self-delusions

i have some challenges, so that i see life differently â€” or, am [playing on different](https://media.tenor.com/wh2x1N-8TW0AAAPo/mario-videogames.mp4) skill level, if you will â€“ i am kinda losing the battle, but nonetheless, i don't mind hanging/collaborating with people that are different than me [or are the way that i was]
um, wise words of experience? none. what have i done utterly wrongly: trusted someone (over and over)
what should someone that could be in my situation do? don't believe anything, ignore faith, hope, words and all the sweet lies. use only mind, in order to follow the right [not so painful] path
